# Analyzing `nesspy` output data

## Static Classes

### Thermodynamic Properties of a System

Thermodynamic properties of a system that can be used in FLEX calculations or analysis can be saved in the `Thermos` class. 

### Lattice Properties

The `Lattice2D` class saves the dimensions as well as details about the periodic boundary conditions of a given simulation.

> [!NOTE]
> Note to myself: `nesspy` should output a `Thermos` and `Lattice` files in the main directory!

## Analysis Classes
### Dynamical Order Disorder Transitions

The class `DynamicalOrderDisorder` expects a parent folder with `out.csv` files in subfolders. Every `out.csv` file corresponds to measurements of an order parameter $m$ at a given $\beta \mu$. 

```python
DynamicalOrderDisorder.get_oder_parameters()
``` 

### Multiple Simulations
To easily get the raw output data from multiple simulations an instance of the class `MultipleSimulations` can be initiated and the `get_raw_data()` method returns the a combined data frame.
