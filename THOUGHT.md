1) Using Curve Fitting for the entire data set without boot strapping leads to a nice curve which approximates the spread of the data set and might be used as a guide to the eyes
2) Iterating that procesure gives a very precise measurement of the peak of the curve to give $\beta \Delta \Phi_c$.
3) I need to calculate the distributions $p(m)$ for every data point $\mu$ --> `{mu: [np.array, np.array]}`
3.1) Comparing two $p(m)$ distributions using the KLD
